# GEINetForCASIA-C

Here GEINet networks have been implimented using keras library, training and testing code implimanted according to CASIA-C gait GEI data set where four normal walking sequences have been taken from each subjects to train model and others pair have been taken as testing group.

The GEINet has been introduced in the following research work:
